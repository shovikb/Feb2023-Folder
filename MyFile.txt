Repositories --> Folders 
Branches (main , master ..) --> Sub Folders
Starred --> Bookmark / Save the URL
Commit :: Finalize the changes

Problem with Bookmark : If URL is lost, then all data is lost

Fork : Keep a copy of the data on your Github Account.
Benefit with Fork : If URL is lost, then all data can be retrieved from that.
